# open_last_bookmark

A short Rust script that finds the url of the last bookmark in my "Take a look" folder and opens it in the default browser.

A short suggestion to build and run this script:

- use `cargo build --release` to create an optimized version of the program
- from the `target` folder copy the `.exe` file (if you are on Windows like me) to a folder that is added to your system `PATH` environment variable
- to run the script quickly just open the windows start menu with the `windows` key
- type in the filename of the `exe` and hit enter
